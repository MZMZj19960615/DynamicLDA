DynamicLDA
==========

Dynamic Topic Model of Reuters News Articles since 2007

example run of text2ldac:

python text2ldac.py reuters1monthsub --stopwords reutersdata/stopwords

where reuters1monthsub is a directory containing the datafiles (generated by __init__.py)

From Reuters data we removed all the docs which have length less than 100 words
We have scrapped random 10% of the data from each day. This was done just to minimize the corpus size.
The assumption is that randomly selected data wont cause problem while find the long and big topics.
we removed all the punctuation marks and performed stemming using Porter2 stemmer
After that we also removed the words which have frequency of less tan 25 or more than 100,000
